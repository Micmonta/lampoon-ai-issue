<b>October:</b> Plenty. She eats her honey with grapes and yogurt with raisins. And when it is pudding time she adds a dollop of snuffling sugar. Yum!

<b>December:</b> Biscuit Corner. Yes, I know all of you eat your biscuits with honey and spices. But ‘tis the season for [whole heart thumping] … biscuits with absolutely nothing else! Now, if you don’t recognize the season, it’s because Matthew just brought home the Southern Living Guide, World War II edition. Look, it says so right here!

<b>April:</b> The Bible. In the morning you will find your father putting away all the bad books you have stolen so far. When you come home, the two of you will read the book together. It’s the shortest book you have ever seen. It was made out of newspapers.

<b>May:</b> From Where I Sit, That’s Pretty High. I am from where I sit. You would be surprised how many books I have stolen. This is especially true because I have never read any of them. I only recently found them. Do you know what I mean? I have been looking for them all these years. There are some that are too good to hand over. You know what they say: too many books spoils the glutton.
