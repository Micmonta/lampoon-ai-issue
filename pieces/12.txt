Sitting on the red cob, crying, I bit into the apple. When I finished, I held the beet in my mouth and laughed, thinking it tasted better than any other beet. Then I remembered: “Antoine, don't be ridiculous. I am the Prince of Darkness. You are the light.”
<br><br>
The other kids said I looked silly. "He is still very much a baby," said one. "We all have those moments we wish we could take care of."
<br><br>
I was left to wade through the water, drowning multiple times.
<br><br>
One time I dived so hard that my arm and hand became entangled in a ball of cotton, which quickly became tangled in my body. My body began to foam and I became entangled in my entrails as well.
<br><br>
Eventually, I freed myself and dove full force into the water, completely submerging my body in the process. I was then pulled out of the water by a lifeguard who had no idea what I was doing. By throwing myself into the opposite direction of the current, I was throwing myself into a dead end.
<br><br>
This time, I didn’t even try to swim. I was too embarrassed to ask any of the other kids for help. Maybe they were too embarrassed to look at me? Maybe they didn’t want to be seen with me?
<br><br>
Somehow, I made it to the other side of the current and tried to swim back out. But I was so weak and exhausted, I just dropped back into the current once more.
<br><br>
All of the kids laughed at me when I tried to swim back out. "He is just a regular kid," they said. "No one will notice him."
<br><br>
I tried to make it look like I had dozed off, drifting back to sleep. But looking at the current, it looked like I had dozed off even more. I was now completely submerged, and the current carried me up the tallest hill in the park.
