Say hello to my little friend!
<br><br>
He is small and fragile, but he gets the job done.
<br><br>
The villagers love him because he keeps peeling potatoes while the adults work around the fire.
<br><br>
“Que cayo ba dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum!” They shout in unison.
<br><br>
“Eu lo hago de forma gratuita!” Big Sam yells. “Yeees!” He reaches his hand out to shake, and a bone shattering pain in his wrist.
<br><br>
“WTF?!” asks a reporter.
<br><br>
Big Sam looks up from the ground and sees the cameraman. “What do you want, Sam?” he replies. “I want you to stop doing that.” The reporter continues to ask.
<br><br>
“I don’t know, like 6 inches?” asks Big Sam.
<br><br>
The cameraman stops shooting.
<br><br>
“That’s enough, Sam. You’re too small. You can’t do this.”
<br><br>
Big Sam hits the ground hard. His fist connects with the pavement and he falls forward, contact with the ground being his only form of support. He sits up, but he is already on his hands and knees. The cameraman pulls out a syringe.
<br><br>
“I need immediate medical attention,” Dr. Dre says through gritted teeth. Big Sam is now on his knees, his arms at his sides. He is gasping for air. Dr. Dre puts a hand on his head.
<br><br>
“I’m sorry, sir, but can you do me? I mean can you do me?”
<br><br>
Big Sam reaches his hand out to the sky. It is as if to say, here, give me a hand, here, give me a hand. But he can’t bring himself to say it. He keeps looking at the ground, trying to recall the last time that he had to make a human sacrifice.
<br><br>
“I am sorry, sir.”
<br><br>
The camera cuts to a shot of Big Sam standing up on his own two feet. He is now six feet tall and strong. He runs off with the angels.
