<b>Day 1:</b> Whoever told me that I'm a loud chewer will pay today. I wasn’t, but that’s easy: I devour all the other people’s crackers.
<br><br>
<b>Day 2:</b> When I look into the eyes of the chewer, I’m reminded of the night my mother abandoned me, barefoot, in the freezing cold. My father, bruised and battered, is left to clean up the mess my mother made of me.
<br><br>
<b>Day 3:</b> Okay this uncontrollable pooping thing has got to change.
