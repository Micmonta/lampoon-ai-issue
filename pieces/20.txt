Hi, I’m back! Much nicer wind coming in tonight. Looks like we’re starting to get some moisture in there. Hey, how about we get some ice cold water and see if that will help. We don’t have any buckets with us so we’re gonna grab some buckets and go get ‘em. Hey, that’s ice cold.
<br><br>
I notice the ice is completely crystal clear. There’s no more magic in this world! I’ll be damned. I grab a handful of ice and pour it over the beans. It looks like it’ll be ice cold almost immediately, but don’t let the snow stop you from having a blast tonight.

Boobs! Now that the snow has melted, and the ice is beginning to bead, the milkman says it’s time for some milk. I say why don’t you try to have some fun? He says I’m really bad at being a father. He doesn’t have any other choice.

I’m giving the kids an ice cream treat when the teenagers swerve onto the road and careen into oncoming traffic. I avoid all sorts of nasty accidents because I am a high-speed chaser. “Well if you see the car coming, you’ll know you’re in for a treat,” snidely remarks one of my students. I laugh it off, knowing my students take offense to the term. The car continues to move forward, and at some point it passes by a flag bearing my own car number. Whew. Okay. So that’s how it works. Ice cream does not.

It’s here where I take my students for their first real ice cream lesson. However, principal is there instead to lecture us about the dangers of saliva mixing with milk and how parents should be super vigilant when their kids play on the swings.
