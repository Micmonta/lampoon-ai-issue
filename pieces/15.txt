The reckoning will come when the squid is in the vernal equinox, when the sun will be at its peak, and the squid will be as big as life itself. The sun will begin to dip below the horizon, and the crew of the craft will realize they are being recorded.

“Yo! I’m the squid, baby! Come play in my ocean for me!” I shout, leaping from jib to jib, never quite reaching the surface. Then, totally out of the water, I am greeted by my second wind.
<br><br>
I am greeted with a succession of shocks as the crew of the craft view me with disgust. All they have is a digital camera, and a hunch.

“We need a picture of you, big guy. Big guy is under contract for life. If you can provide us with a larger boat, we can negotiate a better contract.”

My time on the high seas is coming to an end. I will be returning home, but first, I must climb back into my dinghy and paddle back to the surface.
<br><br>
When I paddle back to the surface, I am greeted with cheers from the crowd. I realize that they booed because they thought I was breaking their world record for biggest cheer.
<br><br>
I return back to the dinghy and paddle slowly, hoping that the coast will remain clear of sharks for the next week.
<br><br>
On week nine, I am shocked, disappointed, and embarrassed by the sheer volume of sharks I have killed.
<br><br>
On week ten, I am amazed, amazed, and embarrassed by the sheer number of sharks I have killed.
<br><br>
On week eleven, I am SHOCKED, DISAPPOINTED, AND HUMILIFIED. How can anyone possibly UNDERSTAND how ridiculous this whole thing is? I am the Sharknado! I am the Sharknado!
<br><br>
On week twelve, I am SHOCKED, DISAPPOINTED, AND HUMILIFIED. How can anyone possibly UNDERSTAND how ridiculous this whole thing is? I am the Sharknado! I am the Sharknado!
