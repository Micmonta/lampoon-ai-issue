In the year 2087, the United States of America is a very different place from where I was born and a very different year from when I was born. There are no states, no cities, and no states constituting anything. There are, however, many different kinds of clones of me, and we are all just me.
<br><br>
I am a clone because all of my limbs are the same, and the same is true of my brain stem. My parents named me Angela. They said I’ll always be just like them, just like them now, and even though I am not.
<br><br>
I feel like a piece of paper. They said I’ll always be safe just like them, even though I am, in fact, one of them. They left me with an aunt and three uncles. All I want is to be like them, and they said I’ll always have a place to sit, a TV, and a safe haven from the world.
<br><br>
I want those things now more than anything in the whole wide–open season. I want it so bad. I want it so bad that I actually start crying, because this is something I have been meaning to do my whole life.
