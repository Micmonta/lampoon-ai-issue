The devil takes it all! Stealing the show! Greedy as all get ish! Tyrannical as a fox! All hail The Hamburglar!
<br><br>
The Hamburglar is a collection of hallmarks, all of which my father gave me as a Christmas present. He’s a city in transition, a place where the police and the fire departments are still fighting one another, and where the synagogues and the wailing mothers of Richmond still cry out for donations. He is, without question, one of the most recognizable faces in the city.
<br><br>
For years, friendly-fire by sound system has been the order of the day in Richmond, but the recent influx of grime has left the Old North State firmly planted in the 1940s.
<br><br>
What my father didn’t give me as a present is the gift of a temper, which I am constantly getting from him. One time I went and got him a new temper, and he was barely out of the bathtub when I got there. Next stop: the dinner room.

So I’m with the rest of my family, we can finally take a break from the gangs and get away from all those guns. As always, stay tuned to the breaking news here at The Wire, we’re keeping you posted on everything from the ground with our very own reporters! Do you have any questions? Any tips? Anything to say, I just happen to know of. Any tips at all?
<br><br>
Everything you need to know about The Wire is right here, my friends: everything you need to know is wrong. I don’t care who you are or what your last name was, you know Jay. You’re black.
<br><br>
We’re all nervous shit here. The whole crew. A great man once quipped: Chicago, you’re a great city. But you know what? You’re a little rat-filled city.
<br><br>
We’re all family, Captain Obvious. That is, everyone is a member of the Mob family. Not all are on our own team. Not all are from South Central. Not all are from the South Central police station. Not all are from the neighborhood. This Christmas, we want all of you to have a good time. That is why we’re bringing you this holiday classic.
<br><br>
Don’t worry, it’s not like we don’t know how to fly. We just need a little brand new training. We’re going to take off for Iraq and we’re not going to be back, ever. There’s no reaper in the North Pole. There’s no jolly roger in the South Pole. There’s just ONE person who can fly, and he’s jalopy roger.
<br><br>
I’m breaking out the locsucker when it comes to this place, so I bring you this sticky note.
