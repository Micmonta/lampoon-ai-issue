You're going crazy, Monsieur Abracadabra.
<br><br>
The jungle is a beautiful place, Monsieur Abracadabra. I wish I could tell you that the Abracadabra climbed it without ropes. That’s a miracle.
<br><br>
I remember when I was a little kid, climbing with my dad on the biggest jump of our jump rope line. My dad was so scared, he didn’t want to go down. My mom helped my dad down.
<br><br>
Careful, he was going to land on his butt if he fell, so he jumped off the highest place possible and was immediately thrown several feet back down onto the ground.
<br><br>
A few more steep slopes later, and I was dangling by my fingertips from my ankles. Abracadabra! My god, what a view. What a view. What a view.
<br><br>
Up ahead, my dad pointed to the road. "Take a sharp right at the fork," he said. "There’s a gas station with a lights-out sign."
<br><br>
Fuck. That’s right, my dad. A real badass. Keep going, and you’ll find a light-speed train that leaves every 15 minutes. It’s the fastest way to go from Point A to B.
<br><br>
"But daddy," I said, holding my head in my hands. "I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the fastest human being alive. Why do you have to be so stupid?"
<br><br>
"Because I’m the one who killed your dad," my dad said, wiping away the tears in his eyes. "I’m the one who killed your dad, and now you’re crying because your dad killed your dad, and now you’re crying because your dad is dead."
<br><br>
I buried my head in my hands, and I felt like a failure. I had tried to do everything perfectly, and then some. I had tried to bury my face in the sand, and I had tried to do that because I was so sad.
