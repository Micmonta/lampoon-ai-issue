They said I'd rue the day I met Mike Myers. I didn’t think they meant Mike Myers as a nickname, or Mike the Cat, or Mike the Octopus, but I waved them off. I wasn’t going to get in trouble with the neighbors again if I just called Mike the Octopus Mike.
<br><br>
The neighbors said they had a right to be angry, and I agreed with them. But I wasn’t going to indulge them. So I’m with the neighbors, and it’s time to act. I’ll be a pariah, and the neighborhood kids are going to have a tough time trusting me once again.

I look around. Everyone seems to like me. A neighbor even gave me a shoutout out of the street. I realize this is a good thing because otherwise I’d have to walk the streets with a shout. I don’t know, like on the block? Big time deal. Just FYI, I live in Queens.
<br><br>
I take my place at the table. Everyone seems to like me because I’m so big. Big time deal. Just FYI, I have a family to feed. Big time!
<br><br>
The food is excellent. My wife actually says I’m the only one who can eat at McDonalds. Not me. I know you all want it, you just can’t cook like that. Not me.
<br><br>
I try my best to sound like I know how to cook, and I try my best to sound like I have all the basic ingredients. You can say “Master of None”, but I want you to know I am.
<br><br>
The food is mediocre at best. The waitress seems to think I’m the only one who can’t cook like that. Me? I cook like that. I know you don’t think I’m a professional chef, but I am not. I could be. You could be a professional chef and I could be your brother.
<br><br>
The wine list is completely blank. Any guesses who would have been on it? Me! I was so excited. Then I realized it was all me!
<br><br>
The food is terrible. I cannot overemphasize how bad it is. The waitress said she was going to -- MIIIIIIIKE!!
