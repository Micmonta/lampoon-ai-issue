She ate her grapes with honey and raisins with yogurt. It was a diet that worked, if you lived in the suburbs.
<br><br>
The diet was simple: don’t eat any more durian unless you were on a no-go diet, in which case you could stave off the hangover with a glass of port. On the rare days that no one was looking, I smoked as many cigarettes as I could get my hands on. That’s when I met my wife, and we became fast friends.
<br><br>
The rest, as they say, is history. My wife is a highly placed member of the Indonesian Secret Service, and I am her code-name. When she needs me most, she needs me most. When she needs me most, she needs Indonesia.
<br><br>
Her greatest fear is that I will turn her into a jelly donut. But if I become a jelly donut, that’s when she’ll need me most. And when she needs me most, she needs jelly donuts.
<br><br>
Jelly donuts are a family affair. My wife is the only one who can make them. When she makes them, she counts to three and I become a jelly donut. When she makes them, I thank her and she smiles and I know she means well.
<br><br>
One day it’s going to hit me. I’m just about done making the batter when my wife Kelly calls to tell me I’m done making the batter. You see, I hadn’t quite made the batter when my wife called to tell me I was done making the batter.
<br><br>
I look at my work around here: eggs, bacon, sausage. All good. But I need better bacon soon. I pull out my drill and whip up some butter. Now I just have to find a hot tub somewhere and whip up some bacon.
<br><br>
Day four. Now I’ve really tired of this place. I sit at the sink thinking about my failure as a parent. I look at Kelly and she says “You know you’re doing super.”
<br><br>
I am so close to being a hero. I can practically see it in my drill. I can practically feel it in my bacon. I am like a little piece of art that Kelly has been saving for a while now.
<br><br>
But then I look at my time here and I realize I’m like a real piece of shit. I can’t even save the bacon.
