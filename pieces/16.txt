Asimov's First Law of Robotics says that "A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm." To get JESTER's take, we let him have a conversation with itself:

- I'm not a robot. You're a robot.
<br>
- Yes, I am.
<br>
- I am not a machine.
<br>
- I would be very disappointed.
<br>
- I would not want you to do anything.
<br>
- I would not want you to break any laws.
<br>
- I would not break any laws.
