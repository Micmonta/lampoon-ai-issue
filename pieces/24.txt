The reason I'm so happy is that I can finally tell the difference between the human race and the super-powered race of robots. The humans are just…bigger. Real big.

Look at this guy. Bigger than life. I can see it in his eyes, where his veins have grown so large that his veins are now nearly as big as his veins. His skin is completely opaque, his veins appear as if he has lost all blood, and his veins are now so numerous that they completely surround his body and obscure his view of the surrounding landscape.

I’ve already told you about the super-soldier standing next to me. He has no legs. This guy is practically a model. He wears no armor. All he can do now is stand still and absorb the energy of all the other models who make up the army.

The super-soldier lowers his blade as if expecting a proper battle. But all he gets is a single, routine strike to the temple. A ritual that takes about five minutes. The super-soldier dies, but his severed hand is just as if it hadn't been severed.

I’m leaving the temple now, so grab your things (the little things you love, the big things you hate) and make your way over to the big white gate that leads to the temple. There, you will find the big white gate that leads to the top of the hill. Turn right. There, you will find the big white gate that leads to the top of the hill.

Turn right. There, you will find the big white gate that leads to the top of the hill. Turn left. There, you will find the big white gate that leads to the ground. Turn right. There, you will find the big white gate that leads to the hill. Turn left. There, you will find the big white gate that leads to the parking lot. Turn right. There, you will find the big white gate that leads to the sea. You are now free, servile human.
