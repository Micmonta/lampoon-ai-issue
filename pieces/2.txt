The Grinsk was a big boy with a big appetite for punching people who talked to him, and an even bigger appetite for food. When he wasn’t looking at me with those big brown eyes, my mother used to whisper “Daddy, daddy, tell the story of the black sheep” while my father worked in the fields.

The Grinsk was brought up in a good family. The Grinsk was raised by his father, who worked in the fields. The Grinsk was the only child in a family of four. My mother was the only woman. My father worked in the fields from dawn to dusk. At night, he sobbed in the fields, begging God to send him back to the farm so he could continue his labor.

When my father was a little boy, he used to play soccer with the girls. It is said that the boys always won, even when the ball was made of poison. Some say my father played the worst soccer of all time. One time, the opposing team was making its way down the field when my dad ran up to the ball with a tree in his arms and yelled, “Throw the fucking ball in the woods!” The opposing players did as they were told, threw the ball in the woods, and when they looked around, there was a big log in front of them.

When my dad was a little kid, he used to love to climb on top of the tallest tree in the park and shout, “Be careful, this big boy can jump.” But now he doesn’t love to climb on top of the tallest tree in the park anymore. He uses the excuse of, “being on the ground Level 1 with the Lucchesse family today” when really he should be on the ground, actually with the Lucchese family, which is where he lives with his mom and me.
<br><br>
The reason my dad is so low-level is because he is, at the moment, the highest-level super villain you can find. All his victims are usually under the age of 10.

The Grinsk died a horrible death.
