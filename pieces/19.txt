The United States of America is truly one big happy family.
<br><br>
Dad is still bouncing off the bathroom floor, his daughter is crying in his arms, and my heart aches for all the children who will be denied the joys of their lives.
<br><br>
Time and again, the Dictator’s minions have failed the people of Albania.
<br><br>
This time, it’s because the Albanian military refused to lay down their weapons and give up their weapons, as ordered by the overwhelming majority of the Albanian people.
<br><br>
The United States of America stands ready to assist the Albanian military in any way that we can.
<br><br>
The United States of America stands ready to provide financial support to the Albanian military, in the form of direct loans, as well as indirect financial support, such as the provision of military equipment.
<br><br>
The United States of America stands ready to provide military assistance in the form of arms and ammunition, as well as medical care and other humanitarian aid.
<br><br>
The United States of America is the finest nation on Earth.
<br><br>
I am, indeed, very well aware that my words have caused considerable unrest in Albania, and among the Albanian people.
<br><br>
It is my hope, Mr. President, that this new beginning will lead to the eventual restoration of the Republic of Albania to power.
<br><br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Albanian President
