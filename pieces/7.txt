It was the dead of night in Miami, but you wouldn’t have known it by the amount of awesome cars on the street. The only thing hotter than these cars? The girls. Tons of girls. Throngs of indescribably beautiful women stood in the audience eagerly awaiting the competitive underground street race that was about to take place. This place was really cool. There were neon lights everywhere. It’s the kind of indescribable scene that would come up if you searched Miami at night, neon lights, hot girls.
