What? If I hooked my arm into the top of this enormous pile of needles and squeezed really hard, I really would have no choice but to amputate my arm. “That also would have been fine,” Dr. Hoberman said, his voice cracking. “But please, don’t tell me you used a walking stick.”

I am still recovering from my first amputee accident, where I nearly threw myself off a crumbling rock face. I had no control over my body's rotation, and I developed a vicious cycle of falls, resulting in me land on my face and eventually my face landing on the rock face.
<br><br>
My second amputee accident saw me get really scared and try to cover my body with my hands, in an effort to keep myself from actually throwing myself off a rock face. But then I remembered that I was an amputee, so I put my hands up and tried to run away, but I ended up getting a broken nose and a black eye from the rock face collision.
<br><br>
And now I’m here with you. I’m amputee. I cannot run. My hands and feet are too small. My arms and legs are too small. I cannot even touch the ground. Do you understand how complex the human body is? It takes two people to care for one amputee. One person with two arms and a leg from a different country. How is that possible?
<br><br>
This is why we’ve got to get rid of the fucking word amputee. Are you prepared to give up on your dreams? Are you prepared to give up on the people you love? Please, vote for Pres. Gore.
