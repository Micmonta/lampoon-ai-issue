Let me get some things straight: I do not “have every disease you can think of, especially the blood diseases” as president-elect Helen Bridges suggested. The reason I am so certain that I am not some sort of miracle worker is that I have tested all the vaccines I could get my hands on. And I have tested every single one of Helen’s vaccines. And I am extremely certain that I am not one of those kids.

As for Helen’s comments, well, I would say that she needs to take her medicine twice a day. I am not a doctor, but I am pretty good at finding the antifungal gel in the bathroom sink. I also happen to know that when it comes to the movies, nobody does a better job than Mira Sorvino in Mean Girls.

As for me, I am a street urchin. I have no idea how I ended up at the top of this building, or why I ended up on the fifth floor. I have no idea what my role in this conspiracy is, or if I am even a part of it. But if I am not a part of it, then nothing you can do. I will be a great leader, just like Arnold did when he ran for president in 1968. I just have no idea how.

Finally, the janitorial staff is completely and utterly racist.
