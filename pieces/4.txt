Dear Sir, Your Honor, and Judges Guild,
<br><br>
I have received multiple complaints regarding the proposed change to the Quidditch schedule. While I support the new ideas behind the idea of three semesters, I do not support the drastic changes to the current rules. As such, I will be modifying the proposed Quidditch schedule from the current five-season structure.

I realize that three semesters is a long time to wait, especially for someone like Tom Bombadil, who is currently battling brain cancer. However, I am changing the rules to allow for a younger, more attractive player like George Ethelbert, who is not as good at singing but is much more talented with his wand at throwing mud.

I realize that three and six are sometimes used interchangeably, but I was not aware that twice was an even number. I am. Sorry.
<br><br>
I am making two acquisitions this afternoon. If you can spare some time, I would appreciate it. Please let me know if you make any additional purchases. I am usually a speedy buyer on Saturday mornings, but sometimes I just donâ€™t make the cut.
<br><br>
I stand by my decision to go to the Muppets.
